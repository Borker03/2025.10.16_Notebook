In terms of calculus, I have learned what a mapping is and what a limit is, as well as the calculation of limits when dealing with infinity and approaching zero.
Additionally, I have studied the criteria for limit calculation, two important limit computation methods, and the comparison of infinitesimals. 
I also independently learned about the relevant types of problems.
